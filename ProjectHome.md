I started this project because the web doesn't provide a reliable source to fetch information about relevant events that have happened in the past. Having a local database seemed pointless at first, but having search all over the place it seems like the best solution. Other database available for download are either too small or too expensive, so this free and rather large database will be useful to some people.

The records are coupled in three categories: Births (46,459 records), Deaths (23,222 records) and Events (50,544 records). Each table has three columns ID (which is unique), DATE (YYYY-MM-DD) and CONTENT (the actual text).

If you require any other formats or information contact me and I will help you.

ENJOY!!!
